**ReactJS** is an open-source JavaScript library designed by Facebook for developing rich and engaging web apps efficiently and quickly with minimal coding.

The core task of ReactJS is providing the best possible rendering performance. Its strength comes from the focus on the individual elements. Instead of working on the complete web app, ReactJS allows a programmer to break down the complex UI into simpler elements.

As per a survey conducted by The State of Javascript, React JS has surpassed Angular and others in becoming the most loved Javascript library.

ReactJs has gained so much popularity due to the following benefits:
- Reusability 

>> Reusability is a well-known aspect among various designers, that saves a lot of rework. One of the major benefits of React JS is that not only fine components like checkboxes or buttons, even complex system elements can also be reused, without the fear of oneâ€™s functionality affecting the other.
- SEO-Friendly

>> Often, applications with a high amount of JavaScript are not readable by the search engines, resulting in a low ranking. Applications based on React JS run on the server & returns the virtual DOM as a regular webpage to the browser, thereby dealing with the issue of search engine failure.
- Faster Rendering

>> While building complex applications, it is important to think about how the structure will affect the performance of a particular application when it is rendered online. React JS has a Virtual DOM that makes a heavy application load quite faster.
