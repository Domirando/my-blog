Summer holidays! Speaking about my summer holidays, first I can tell that it was one of my most attractive, useful and fantastic holidays, I think that is because my plan was good, so let’s check it out now 🌈.

When my expected, looked forward the most long holiday started I was super happy and gave a cry “HAPPY SUMMER HOLIDAY!!!” As far as I concerned, that’s because exams had finished.

As per a survey conducted by The State of Javascript, React JS has surpassed Angular and others in becoming the most loved Javascript library.

So my first week of holiday was spent for making plans, relaxing and helping to mom in household activities. Truly making plans were very hard.

Moreover, I raised my knowledge from IT and around of 29th of June I visited my parents, village and were there approximately 10 days. So these 10 days were one of the most attractive days of my holiday.

Furthermore, my next journey was to my mother town, Fergana. There I was busy with relaxing, doing household activities and improving my math knowledge with self-studying. And I understood that self-studying is one of the most proper way for studying.

Apart from this, in 17th of July I celebrated my birthday and this day was fantastic and one of my most memorable birthdays. After my celebrating day I started solving 100 math problems which were given by my math teacher.

What is more, in around of 20th of August I came back to the capital city of my country and started improving my language skill. Every night, I walked and ate ice-cream with my family. And last days of my holiday I made a plan and aims for my academic year

In conclusion, I can tell you for sure this holiday was one of my most effective and attractive holidays.
