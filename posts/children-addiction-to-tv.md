It isn’t secret for anybody that the world is developing day by day and the school program is becoming harder depending on development of world and demand. So every parent starts having and giving a questions like “Do my children not watch too much TV? Are they studying hard? Are they far enough from embrangling activities like playing games or chatting too much, wasting time?”

![Ooops, something went wrong... ](/images/children-addiction.jpg)

First, we have to avow that world is really maturing so the insistence to intelligent people is increasing therefore the requirement of parents and school is increasing. That is why the school program is becoming harder and homework, extra activities are given more that previous years. So that shows children do not have time for wasting their time and they are nor watching TV nor playing games.

On other hand you can be worried about your brother or children. Because not having a leisure time and not relaxing by watching TV can damage children physically and even logically and even hurt.

But not, in my way of thinking it is incorrect thought at all. Because in my opinion watching TV has enough amount of minuses too. For instance, maybe the cartoon or movie which child is watching can have bad meaning or it can be not appropriate for child’s age or the simplest example which can everyone notice or see is the harm to vision.

Consequently, because of progressing world so increasing the requirements of school is causing to watching TV not a lot as in past.And this is for the best to children.
